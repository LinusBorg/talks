# Links from the Talk "Introducing Vue" 2019-06-25 @ JUG HH

I did my presentation in Keynote, and made rthe mistake of embedding some links as clickable images in the slides.

Whoever has a Mac should be able to use the links directly from the slides, but others might be on windows, so I make this little collection for you to reference. That was faster than redesigning the slides to make room for links, and easier to click ;)
